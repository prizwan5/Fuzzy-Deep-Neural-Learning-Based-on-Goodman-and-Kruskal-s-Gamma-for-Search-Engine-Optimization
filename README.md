# Fuzzy-Deep-Neural-Learning-Based-on-Goodman-and-Kruskal-s-Gamma-for-Search-Engine-Optimization
Search engine optimization (SEO) is a significant problem for enhancing a websiteâ€™s visibility with search engine results. SEO issues, such as Site Popularity (SP), Content Quality (CQ), Keyword Density (KD), and Publicity (P), were not considered during the search engine optimization process. Therefore, the retrieval rate of the existing technique was inadequate.The Triangular Fuzzy Deep Structured Learning-Based Predictive Page Ranking (TFDSL-PPR) Technique is proposed to solve these limitations. The TFDSL-PPR technique at first takes a number of user queries as input in the input layer. It then employs the four hidden layers in order to analyze the web pages based on an input query deeply.The first hidden layerdetermines the keywords from the user query. The second hidden layer measures the site popularity, content quality, keyword density and publicity of all web pages in the search engine.  It then accomplishes Goodman and Kruskal's Gamma Predictive Ranking process in the third hidden layer, where it ranks the web pages by considering their similarities. The experiment with the TFDSL-PPR technique is conducted using metrics such as retrieval rate, time, and false positive rate and by using the ClueWeb09 Dataset with respect to a variety of user queries.
